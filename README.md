# javascript-resource-generator
Turns json from The Library Corporation's LS2 PAC RSS Feed into a minimalist website for printing as a resource guide

This uses json stored in a .js file to output a webpage.  The end goal would be to have it pull the information from the live rss feed allowing for constantly updated pages, but my attempts with circumventing cross site scripting errors have proved unsuccessful with the level of access I have to the server that the data is stored on.
